## General info
This was a fun python project that I wanted to create on my own.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.7.6
* pygame version: 1.9.6
* mutagen version: 1.45.1

## Features
* Plays .mp3 audio files
* Displays the name of the .mp3 file
#### To Do:
* Load any song that you want from the Music directory with the load button
* Play, pause, and stop .mp3 files with their respective buttons
* Use the previous and next buttons to play the previous or next file
* Shuffle button to play a random .mp3 file from the Music directory

## Setup
To run this project, you must have Python 3 (I used Python 3.7.6):

```
$ cd ../MP3_Player
$ python MP3.py
```
It will take some time to boot up because it is trying to find the MP3_Player directory on your device
